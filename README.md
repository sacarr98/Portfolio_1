## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

#### First Time Visitor Goals

- To quickly find information about meditative techniques that can improve mental well-being
- To be encouraged to focus more on personal well-being by learning how simple it is to encorporate into everyday life
- To be able to easily navigate between pages display different well-being techniques

## Design

### Colour Scheme

We wanted to have a colour scheme that was not too bright and that had a calming feel upon visiting the site. So we chose pale blues, and plain black and white for accessibility and to reduce cognitive overload.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for this site.

We chose Josefin sans for main headings and Ysabeau SC for everything else. We felt these were complimentary fonts, easy to read and in keeping with the peaceful vibe we wanted the website to have.

### Imagery

All imagery used showed peaceful environments, mostly of nature (ocean, forest scenes) to give the sense of tranquility. Pictures of people in a meditative state were also used ensuring people of a variety of demographics were represented so all users would feel at home on our website.

### Wireframes

<img src="assets/images/signupform_wireframe.PNG" alt="wire frame of sign-up page" title="Sign-up page">

## Features

The website comprised of 5 pages, the index page, 3 informative pages, and a sign-up page.

### General features on each page

All pages are divided into 4 main sections, the navigation section, a banner displaying an image and the main heading, the information section (which is then divided further depending on the page), and the footer containing links to all social media pages. This remained consistant throughout the site for easy access and user experience. Across all pages it was ensured the banner did not occupy the entire length of the screen to encourage users to scroll down to read more.

A drop-down 'practices' tab was used in the navigation header which then displayed the 3 practices pages. This was chosen to reduce cognitive overload reducing the number of visible navigation tabs to the user.

The index page is designed to draw users in by highlighting the need for the resources provided on the site and summarising the information available.

The practices pages make use of engaging imagery, videos, and audio files to break up the text so it is less overwhelming for users and more visually stimulating.

The sign-up page follows conventions users will be familiar with, and makes use of hover features on text boxes for easy navigation, with pop-up messages when a section needs to be filled.

### Future Implementations

In future I would like to create a login option in order to create a user network so users can encourage eachother on their journey in improved mental well-being.

### Accessibility

We have actively tried to ensure our website is accessible friendly as possible, we achieved this by:
- Using semantic HTML
- Ensuring sufficient colour contrast throughout the site and using easily readable fonts
- Providing information for screen readers where icons were used in place of text, for example for our social media icons in the footer
