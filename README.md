# PORTFOLIO 1 - "Breathe"

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of this section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#bully-book-club-website)

Add a Blurb about the site here, what does it do, why did you build it?

Add an image of the finished site here. I like to use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) to get an image of my site on all device sizes, and amiresponsive allows you to click links on the page and scroll, so each device can show a different element of your site.

Add a link to the live site here, for Milestone 1 this will be the GitHub Pages Link from when you deployed the site.

If you want to add optional [shields.io](https://shields.io) badges to your README, I like to add them to this section.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

#### First Time Visitor Goals

- To quickly find information about meditative techniques that can improve mental well-being
- To be encouraged to focus more on personal well-being by learning how simple it is to encorporate into everyday life
- To be able to easily navigate between pages display different well-being techniques

## Design

### Colour Scheme

We wanted to have a colour scheme that was not too bright and that had a calming feel upon visiting the site. So we chose pale blues, and plain black and white for accessibility and to reduce cognitive overload.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for this site.

We chose Josefin sans for main headings and Ysabeau SC for everything else. We felt these were complimentary fonts, easy to read and in keeping with the peaceful vibe we wanted the website to have.

### Imagery

All imagery used showed peaceful environments, mostly of nature (ocean, forest scenes) to give the sense of tranquility. Pictures of people in a meditative state were also used ensuring people of a variety of demographics were represented so all users would feel at home on our website.

### Wireframes

Add the images or links for your wireframes here.

There are lots of different options to create your wireframes - Code Institute students can access [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) as part of the course.

Some other options include [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [AdobeXD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html), [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&adgroup=uxui&device=c&matchtype=e&utm_campaign=ADDICTMOBILE_SKETCH_GAD_DG_UK_T1_ALWAYS-ON_S_TRF_PROS_BRAND&utm_term=sketch&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=TOF_BRND__generic&hsa_acc=8710913982&hsa_cam=16831089317&hsa_grp=134620695759&hsa_ad=592060065319&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-14921750&hsa_kw=sketch&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwr4eYBhDrARIsANPywCjRIFn93DMezYnsyE5Fic_8l8kynJtut0GYMU01TiohHjwziFtlH0gaAhteEALw_wcB) and [Mockup](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mockup-sketch-ui-ux/id1527554407) to name just a few! Or you can even go old school and get those wireframes completed using pen and paper. Just snap an image of the completed wireframes to add the images to the README.

## Features

The website comprised of 5 pages, the index page, 3 informative pages, and a sign-up page.

### General features on each page

All pages are divided into 4 main sections, the navigation section, a banner displaying an image and the main heading, the information section (which is then divided further depending on the page), and the footer containing links to all social media pages. This remained consistant throughout the site for easy access and user experience. Across all pages it was ensured the banner did not occupy the entire length of the screen to encourage users to scroll down to read more.

A drop-down 'practices' tab was used in the navigation header which then displayed the 3 practices pages. This was chosen to reduce cognitive overload reducing the number of visible navigation tabs to the user.

The index page is designed to draw users in by highlighting the need for the resources provided on the site and summarising the information available.

The practices pages make use of engaging imagery, videos, and audio files to break up the text so it is less overwhelming for users and more visually stimulating.

The sign-up page follows conventions users will be familiar with, and makes use of hover features on text boxes for easy navigation.

### Future Implementations

In future I would like to create a login option in order to create a user network so users can encourage eachother on their journey in improved mental well-being.

### Accessibility

We have actively tried to ensure our website is accessible friendly as possible, we achieved this by:
- Using semantic HTML
- Ensuring sufficient colour contrast throughout the site and using easily readable fonts
- Providing information for screen readers where icons were used in place of text, for example for our social media icons in the footer

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

HTML, CSS

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Balsamiq - for wireframes

Login or Sign Up to GitHub.
Open the project repository.
Click on "Settings" on the navigation bar under the repository title.
Click on "Pages" in the left hand navigation panel.
Under "Source", choose which branch to deploy. This should be Main for newer repositories (older repositories may still use Master).
Choose which folder to deploy from, usually "/root".
Click "Save", then wait for it to be deployed. It can take some time for the page to be fully deployed.
Your URL will be displayed above "Source".

### Local Development

- Log in to Github
- Go to the repository for this project 
- Click the Fork button in the top right corner

#### How to Clone

To clone the repository:
- Log in to GitHub
- Go to the repository for this project
- Click on the code button, select whether you would like to clone with HTTPS, SSH or GitHub CLI and copy the link shown.
- Open the terminal in your code editor and change the current working directory to the location you want to use for the cloned directory.
- Type 'git clone' into the terminal and then paste the link you copied in step 3. Press enter.

## Testing

Please view ......... for the testing documentation.
  
Use this part of the README to link to your TESTING.md file - you can view the example TESTING.md file [here](milestone1-testing.md)

## Credits

### Code Used

The code was written by myself with some parts being taken from the Love Running project - for example the footer and the sign-up page.

### Content

The content for the site was created by myself, with the yoga video being embedded from Youtube, and through carrying out research into mindfulness techniques.

### ¬†Media

If you have used any media on your site (images, audio, video etc) you can credit them here. I like to link back to the source where I found the media, and include where on the site the image is used.
  
### ¬†Acknowledgments

If someone helped you out during your project, you can acknowledge them here! For example someone may have taken the time to help you on slack with a problem. Pop a little thank you here with a note of what they helped you with (I like to try and link back to their GitHub or Linked In account too). This is also a great place to thank your mentor and tutor support if you used them.
