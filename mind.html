                        As you being walking bring awareness to the soles of you feet. How

                        After a few minutes shift the attention to your ankless and calves.
                        How do they feel? Tired? Strong?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then shift your attention to your upper legs. Become aware of the
                        muscles working with each step.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now become aware of the movements and sensations in your hips. Do
                        they way as you walk? Or are they rigid?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can then raise your attention to your torso, feel each breath
                        and the rhythm of your heartbeat.

                    <li>
                        After a few minutes, begin to become aware of your shoulders, relax
                        them down with each step.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lastly notice the way your head moves up and down with the rhythm of
                        your steps.

                    <li>
                        Continue to scan your body for the duration of your walk, focusing
